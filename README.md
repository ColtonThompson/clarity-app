### Prompt
Build a SPA React JS driven cart/checkout page thatâ€™s essentially wiring up the two sets of UI code referenced above. Provide the ability for the cart to calculate totals based on quantity changes and also to remove items from the cart using the delete button. Then upon clicking checkout use routing to show a checkout directive that has the simple card number/expiration, etc. panel and the total passed along from the cart directive. 

The Client has asked that you complete 2 hours of work on this task before checking in. They will be evaluating your communication, technical, and organization skills before choosing to continue working with our firm. Please make as much headway as possible within the 2 hour timeframe and then reply with reviewable files. We understand that you will only be able to make so much headway in 2 hours. This is mostly a test of your organization skills, ability to communicate with the Client and to leverage tools/systems to deliver on your project (i.e. React, Bootstrap, etc.).
