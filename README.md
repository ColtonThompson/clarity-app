### Clarity Ventures - Project Scenario

This is the result of learning React and building an app doing exactly 2 hours of work and then stopping. This was my first time working with React. I was able to cut the given templates into React elements and render them seperately however I ran out of time to get to functionality for clicking buttons, however I did get the product list to show in the cart using an array that is passed from a parent to child object.

I want to add here that I knew relatively nothing about React other than it was used to build user interfaces for web based applications until the morning of this project starting. I spent 8+ hours researching and learning to be able to produce this very basic amount of work in two hours and for that I can say I am proud of myself.

### Prompt
Build a SPA React JS driven cart/checkout page thatâ€™s essentially wiring up the two sets of UI code referenced above. Provide the ability for the cart to calculate totals based on quantity changes and also to remove items from the cart using the delete button. Then upon clicking checkout use routing to show a checkout directive that has the simple card number/expiration, etc. panel and the total passed along from the cart directive. 

The Client has asked that you complete 2 hours of work on this task before checking in. They will be evaluating your communication, technical, and organization skills before choosing to continue working with our firm. Please make as much headway as possible within the 2 hour timeframe and then reply with reviewable files. We understand that you will only be able to make so much headway in 2 hours. This is mostly a test of your organization skills, ability to communicate with the Client and to leverage tools/systems to deliver on your project (i.e. React, Bootstrap, etc.).
