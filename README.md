### Clarity Ventures - Project Scenario

This is the result of learning React and building an app doing exactly 2 hours of work and then stopping. This was my first time working with React. I was able to cut the given templates into React elements and render them seperately however I ran out of time to get to functionality for clicking buttons, however I did get the product list to show in the cart using an array that is passed from a parent to child object.

I want to add here that I knew relatively nothing about React other than it was used to build user interfaces for web based applications until the morning of this project starting. I spent 8+ hours researching and learning to be able to produce this very basic amount of work in two hours and for that I can say I am proud of myself.

### UPDATES

## WIP #1: Learning Modals
I have now spent an additional two hours on this particular application and the focus of this time was spent learning modals and how they function. The goal is to allow the user to click the "Continue to Checkout" button after completing the billing address form information. I wanted to push an in progress version to continue the story of how I am learning react, this build shows the checkout modal regardless of the showCheckout state property being true or false. In the next update I hope to have this fixed and working as intended. I believe I need to restructure the HTML and JSX to allow the modal tag to feed style information. Currently sending the raw HTML is missing some styles that comes with the checkout cart template.

### Prompt
Build a SPA React JS driven cart/checkout page thatâ€™s essentially wiring up the two sets of UI code referenced above. Provide the ability for the cart to calculate totals based on quantity changes and also to remove items from the cart using the delete button. Then upon clicking checkout use routing to show a checkout directive that has the simple card number/expiration, etc. panel and the total passed along from the cart directive.
